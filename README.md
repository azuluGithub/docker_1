# docker_1
The aim of the Docker-1 project is to make you handle docker and docker-machine, the bases to understand the idea of containerization of services.

In this first part you will be introduced to Docker and its main options. In your repository, create a 00_how_to_docker folder in which you will push the solutions for all exercises.
If you donâ€™t have it already, install docker, docker-machine and virtualbox. Docker and docker-machine can be installed via Brew, and virtualbox via the Managed Soft- ware Center.
